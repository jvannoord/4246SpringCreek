		"Awesome Ralph Black-built home with 4 bedrooms, 3.5(!) bathrooms and 2-car garage. HUGE and spacious kitchen with granite countertops and Jenn-Air oven+stove. ENORMOUS master bedroom with spa-like bathroom and a walk-in closet as large as other homes' bedrooms. 2 gas fireplaces! Guest room has its own full bathroom. A covered porch on the front and open-air deck on the back that both feature aluminum railings and Trex decking. House borders a greenbelt, assuring that no one will ever build anything else nearby.",
		"What do we love about this home? It's close to everything, but it's not on a busy street. And there's with a designated greenbelt behind the home. In the spring, we go to sleep listening to croaking frogs and wake up to chirping birds. And, of course, the kitchen! And the huge walk-in closet! And the fireplace in the master bedroom!"
